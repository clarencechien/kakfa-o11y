    # Simulate selecting the "Welcome & Setup" page
    # This requires calling the part of app.py that handles page selection,
    # or refactoring app.py to have a function for each page.
    # For now, let's assume we can call a hypothetical function or directly test conditions.

    # To test the current structure, we'd need to simulate app.py's main execution flow slightly.
    # This is tricky as st.radio is interactive.
    # A simpler approach for unit tests is to refactor page content into functions.

    # Let's assume a refactor where page content is in functions like:
    # def render_welcome_page():
    #    st.header(...)
    #    st.markdown(...)
    #
    # If app.py was structured like that:
    # streamlit_app.render_welcome_page()
    # mock_st_header.assert_any_call("Welcome to the Kafka Observability Tutorial!")
    # mock_st_markdown.assert_any_call(streamlit_app.load_markdown("content/welcome.md"))

    # Given current app.py, we can test the if block for a page.
    # This is still not ideal as it tests implementation details.
    with patch('streamlit_app.page_selection', "1. Welcome & Setup"): # Mock the selected page
        # Manually trigger the part of the app that would render this page.
        # This requires a bit of knowledge of app.py's top-level script flow.
        # For this test, we'll just assert that if page_selection IS "1. Welcome & Setup",
        # the load_markdown for 'welcome.md' would be called.

        # More practically, let's test a small part of a page's logic if possible
        # without running the whole Streamlit app script.

        # If app.py had:
        # if page_selection == "1. Welcome & Setup":
        #   render_my_welcome_content()
        # We could mock render_my_welcome_content and check if it's called.

        # For the current app.py, the st calls are direct.
        # We can't easily isolate a page's rendering without running the script or refactoring.

        # This test will be a placeholder for how one MIGHT test Streamlit calls
        # if the app was refactored for better testability.
        mock_st_title = mocker.patch('streamlit_app.st.title') # Assuming title is called once at top

        # To truly test page rendering, one would need to either:
        # 1. Refactor app.py to have functions per page.
        # 2. Use a tool that can run Streamlit apps and inspect the output (more like integration/E2E).

        # For now, this test will just be a conceptual placeholder for mocking st calls.
        assert True # Placeholder, real assertions would be like mock_st_header.assert_called_with(...)
